# using Third-Party APIs (bootstrap, jquery, moment, fontawesome) for a Work Day Scheduler

## the Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

The app:

* Displays the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-codes each timeblock based on past(grey), present(red), and future(green) when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allows a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

## notes

bootstrap container class and rows are used in index.html. the rest of the html is generated dynamically using jquery. An event listener is added to the save buttons and when clicked, the schedule event data is inserted into the scheduled events array and to local storage for persistence. Note that a separate clear function is not required, so to clear a scheduled event, the user has to save an empty scheduled event!
